This website will give you an overview of my academic and professional career, as well as some of my interests. And you will also find some articles about different topics.  

I am a Business Information Systems and Data Analysis student at **[Paris Dauphine University](https://dauphine.psl.eu/en/)**. I'm also working as a Data Science Retail Banking apprentice at **[Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale](https://www.societegenerale.com/en)**.

My educational career was marked by a lot of moving between cities and compuses (Akka, Tata, Taroudant, Agadir, Rabat...). And this made a significant contribution in the process of developping my personality, building my network, and acquiring a variety of skills.    

I had my baccalaureate in Mathematical Sciences in 2017 with an Honours degree at the __Technical Highschool__, _Taroudant, Morocco_. I then went to __Mohammed Reda Slaoui Preparatory Classes__ in _Agadir_ the same year and studied Maths And Physics for two years. In 2019, I went to the **[National Institute of Posts and Telecommunications](http://inpt.ac.ma)** in _Rabat_ where I studying __Data Engineering__ for 2 years before moving to Bordeaux in order to study _Artificial intelligence_ at **[ENSEIRB-MATMECA](https://enseirb-matmeca.bordeaux-inp.fr/fr)** as part of an exchange programme. I successfully got my Engineer diploma, and then, in 2022, I started studying Business Information Systems and Data Analysis at **[Paris Dauphine University](https://dauphine.psl.eu/en/)**

### Main interests and projects

My main interests are Data Science, Machine Learning, and Marketing Analysis. The first time I worked on a <a href='/files/Rapport_TIPE_2019.pdf' style='color : rgb(210,120,0);'>machine learning project</a> was in my final year at the Preparatory Classes as part of the TIPE (_Traveaux d'Initiative Personnelle Encadr√©s_), in which I trained a [convolutional neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) to guide a vehicle through an empty track. I used [Udacity's Self-Driving Car Simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim) for generating the training and the testing data (_TRAINING MODE_), as well as for testing the performance of the car after I paired it with the trained model (_AUTONOMOUS MODE_).  
I had so much fun working on this project. I especially enjoyed the process of collecting data and testing the car on the simulator.
  
![training_mode](/images/10.jpg "This is not a video game lol. I was collecting road data (steering angle, speed, acceleration...) by driving the car manually")  

I also carried out a <a href='https://github.com/KouhouMed/scrapping_avito.ma' style='color : rgb(210,120,0);'>web scrapping project</a> in which I extracted around 13 000 items on the famous advertisements website [Avito.ma](https://avito.ma) using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` and performed statistical studies on them.  

I love NLP ([Natural Language Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing)), and my latest <a href='https://github.com/KouhouMed/disaster-tweet-classification/' style='color : rgb(210,120,0);'>mini-project</a> was about determining, among a set of tweets, which relate to a disaster and which don't, using NLP along with different machine learning algorithms, and then I compared the efficiency of each one of these algorithms.  

### Badges and certificates

I am glad that I had the chance to take many online courses in different domains especially those related to my area of expertise and earn a certificate for each one of them :

### Extracurricular & Volunteering Experiences

As an active member of [CIT Club](m.facebook.com/CIT.INPT/), I've proudly been part of the organization staff of its two main events ([JNJD](https://www.facebook.com/JNJD.CIT/) and [IDEH](https://www.linkedin.com/events/6605234090222460928/)) last year. And this year, I have been elected Treasurer of the club.  
I've also volunteered as an organizer of the 1<sup>st</sup> edition of the [Digital Job Fair](https://www.facebook.com/events/institut-national-des-postes-et-t√©l√©communications/digital-job-fair/219488442411210/).  

### Hobbies and pastime activities

I'm so passionate about photography üì∏ , music üé∂, and reading üìö
