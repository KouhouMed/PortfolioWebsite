In a <a href="https://kouhoumed.site/blog/supervised-learning-algorithms-r/">previous article</a>, we have explained the principles of K-Nearest Neighbours and Decision Trees and seen hands-on examples of how these models can be created using R programming language. In this article, we will continue on the same track and see other supervised learning algorithms, namely **Linear Regression** and **Logistic Regression**.

## Linear Regression

>**Linear Regression** is a predictive model used to predict the outcome value of an outcome variable Y based on one or more input predictor variables X. The aim is to establish a linear relationship (a mathematical formula) between the predictor variable(s) and the response variable, so that we can use this formula to estimate the value of the response Y, when only the predictors values are known.
