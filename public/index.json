    "body": "As I mentioned in an earlier post, machine learning algorithms are categorized into three main types :\n Supervised learning algorithms Unsupervised learning algorithms Reinfocement learning algorithms  In this article, we will only talk about some of machine learning supervised algorithms. We\u0026rsquo;ll also see examples using R programming language.\nFirst of all, I would like to remind you that supervised learning is a machine learning algorithm that tries to find a function mapping an input to a given output based on a set of examples. Basically, each of these examples (called training set) consists of the input $X$ and the desired output $Y$. In other words, we try to approximate the function $f$ such that $f(X)=Y$ using previously labelled data as learning examples. The performance of such a model is evaluated upon its ability to generalize onto new data that is unlabeled.\nK-Nearest Neighbours K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) is a simple Machine Learning algorithm based on Supervised Learning technique. It can be used for both regression and classification, but it is mostly used in classification.\nSuppose we have two categories : Category $A$ and Category $B$, and we have a new data point $x$ that we want to know to which category it belongs.\n\rKNN algorithm is comprised of the following steps :\n Step 1 : Select K, number of neighbours Step 2 : Calculate the distance of between $x$ and each of the other data points (we can use the Euclidian distance or others) Step 3 : Take the K nearest neighbors as per the calculated Euclidean distance. Step 4 : Among these k neighbors, count the number of the data points in each category. Step 5 : Assign the new data points to that category for which the number of the neighbor is maximum.  NB 1 : The Euclidian distance between two points $a_1(x_1,y_1)$ and $a_2(x_2,y_2)$ is calculated as follows : $$d(a_1,a_2)=\\sqrt{(x_1-x_2)^2+(y_1-y_2)^2}$$\n\rA more general formula in an n-dimensional space is : $$d(x,y)=\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-y_i)^2}$$ where $x(x_1,...,x_n)$ and $y(y_1,...,y_n)$.\rNB 2 : As can be seen, there are no parameters that need to be learned during training to determine whether a new observation belongs to class ùê¥ or ùêµ. The only parameter used in k-nearest neighbours is K, which is a predetermined value. The algorithm simply works by looking at the training samples, calculating distances and finding the K examples in the training set that are closest to the new observation. Thus, KNN is a non-parametric, supervised (needs training labels) learning algorithm.\nNB 3 : KNN does support categorical variables as features, simply because we cannot calculated the distance from them.\n",

    "body": " \u0026ldquo;What we want is a machine that can learn from experience\u0026rdquo;\nAlan Turing, 1947\n What is machine learning ? Machine learning is a form of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows a system to learn from data without explicitly programming the instructions to be executed. However, machine learning is not a simple process. As the algorithms ingest the training data, it becomes possible to create more accurate models based on that data. A machine learning model is the output generated when you train your machine learning algorithm with data. After training, when you provide input data to a model, you receive an output result. For example, a predictive algorithm creates a predictive model. Then, when you provide data to the predictive model, you receive a forecast that is determined by the data that was used to train the model.\nIterative learning from data Machine learning allows models to train on datasets before being deployed. Some machine learning models are online and operate continuously. This iterative process of inline models improves the types of associations established between data elements. Due to their complexity and size, these trends and associations may not be detected by a human observer. Once a model has been trained, it can be used in real time to learn from the data. Improvements in accuracy result from the training and automation process that is part of machine learning.\nMachine learning approaches Machine learning techniques are needed to improve the accuracy of predictive models. Depending on the nature of the business problem being addressed, there are different approaches that vary depending on the type and volume of data. In this section, we discuss the categories of machine learning.\nSupervised learning Supervised learning usually begins with a well-defined data set and some understanding of how that data is classified. The goal of supervised learning is to uncover patterns in data and apply them to an analytical process. These data include characteristics associated with labels that define their meaning. You can, for example, create a machine learning application that can distinguish between millions of animals, based on pictures and written descriptions.\nUnsupervised learning Unsupervised learning is used when the problem requires a massive amount of unlabeled data. For example, social media apps like Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat all mine very large amounts of untagged data. To understand the meaning of this data, it is necessary to use algorithms that classify the data according to the trends or clusters they detect. Unsupervised learning leads an iterative process, analyzing data without human intervention. It is used with spam detection technology sent by e-mail. Normal emails and spam have too many variables for an analyst to tag spam emails sent in bulk. In contrast, machine learning discriminants, based on clustering and association, are applied to identify unwanted emails.\nReinforcement learning Reinforcement learning is a model of behavioral learning. The algorithm receives feedback from the data analysis and guides the user to the best result. Reinforcement learning differs from other types of supervised learning in that the system is not trained with a sample data set. Instead, the system learns instead through a trial and error method. Therefore, a sequence of successful decisions results in the strengthening of the process, because it is the process that most effectively solves the problem at hand.\nNeural networks and deep learning  Deep learning is a specific method of machine learning that integrates neural networks in successive layers in order to learn data iteratively. Deep learning is especially useful when trying to spot trends from unstructured data. Complex deep learning neural networks are designed to emulate how the human brain works, so computers can be trained to deal with ill-defined abstractions and problems. Most five-year-olds easily distinguish the face of their teacher from that of the officer responsible for taking them across the crosswalk. On the other hand, the computer must do a considerable amount of work to identify each face. Neural networks and deep learning are often used in image recognition, oral communication and digital vision applications.\rMachine learning vs Statistical Modeling Statistical modeling and machine learning can be mixed up sometimes. But there is a difference between these two concepts. Machine Learning is an algorithm that can learn from data without being explicitly programmed or relying on standard programming practices. Here are some important facts about machine learning :\n Machine learning is a newer field of study than statistics (machine learning was invented in 1959, whereas statistics originated in the 17th century) Machine learning can result in more detailed information than statisticl modeling Machine learning is a subfield of computer science and A.I and contributes to building systems that can learn from data without explicit programming Finally, machine learning uses fewer assumptions than statistcal modeling  Statistical Modeling is the formalization of relationships between variables in the form of mathematical equations. It is a subfield of math that deals with finding relationships between variables to predict outcomes. It deals with a small amount of data with fewer attributes and, as such, there is a good chance that over-fitting will occur.\nStatistical modeling requires the modeller to understand the relation and implementation that a variable has on an equation, in an effort to best \u0026ldquo;estimate\u0026rdquo; the function output to a certain error.\nOn the other hand, machine Learning requires minimal human effort, as the workload involved in computing is placed squarely on the machine. Furthermore, Machine Learning has a strong predictive power, as the machine is \u0026ldquo;fit\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;trained\u0026rdquo; to find patterns in the data.\n    Machine Learning Statistical Modeling      Network, Graphs Model    Weights Parameters    Learning Fitting    Supervised Learning Regression/Classification    Unsupervised Learning Density Estimation/Clustering    ",

    "body": " ‚ÄúYou can have data without information, but you cannot have information without data.‚Äù ‚Äì Daniel Keys Moran\n Data science is one of the most debated topics in the industries these days. Its popularity has grown over the years, and companies have started implementing data science techniques to grow their business and increase customer satisfaction. According to a study conducted in 2013, 90% of the world\u0026rsquo;s data has been produced within the previous two years. In 2020, the global amount of data is projected to reach 59 zettabytes. Given the massive amount of data that is being created every second, people in almost all industries have become concerned as to how to make use of all this data being produced. This is when Data Science comes into play.\nWhat is Data Science ? Data science is the domain of study that deals with vast volumes of data using modern tools and techniques to find unseen patterns, derive meaningful information, and make business decisions. Data science uses complex machine learning algorithms to build predictive models.\n \u0026ldquo;Data Scientist (n.): Person who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician.\u0026rdquo; ‚Äì Josh Wells\n \rData science combines the scientific method, math and statistics, specialized programming, advanced analytics, AI, and even storytelling to uncover and explain the business insights buried in data.It envolves preparing raw data to make it ready for processing, performing data analysis, and presenting the results to reveal patterns abd enable stakeholders to extract useful insights.\nData preparation envolves cleaning, aggregating, and manipulating data in a way that makes it suitable for the desired type of processing. As for analysis, it is requires algorithms and AI models to explore the data and extract patterns. Decisions will be taken based on the predictions that have been with the models.\nIn order for these models to be able to predict reliably, they have to be optimized through training. And the accuracy of the predictions must be validated through scientifically designed tests and experiments.\nWhat are the prerequisites and skills for Data Science ? a data scientist must be able to do the following tasks :\n Apply mathematics, statistics, and the scientific method Use a variety of tools and techniques for evaluating and preparing data (SQL, data mining, data integration methods\u0026hellip;) Extract insights from data using predictive analytics and artificial intelligence (AI), including machine learning and deep learning models Write applications that automate data processing and calculations Tell stories that clearly depict the results of the analysis process (this is usually done through visualization and other techniques) Explain how these results can be used to solve business problems  Technical prerequisites for Data Science Here are some technical demands you should know before setting of a data science journey :\n  Mathematics : data science requires some basic knowledge in certain mathematical concepts such as calculus, linear algebra, probability, statistics, information theory\u0026hellip; data scientists should be familiar with these concepts in order to be able to fully understand the magic behind statistical and machine learning models, and thus be capable of adapting them to their needs.\n  Programming : some programming skills are needed to execute successful data science projects. It is not required to be a hardcore programmer to help analyze widespread parts of data, to write quotes efficiently to explain the problem area and work with big data. Data science works on programming tools like Python and R. These concepts will help the candidate to journey a long way into the expertise of data science.\n  Databases : they are an essential component of data science. Data scientists need to understand how databases work, how to manage them, and how to extract data from them.\n  Machine learning : it is one of the most fundamental concepts of data science. Data Scientists need to have a solid grasp on ML in addition to basic knowledge of statistics.\n     Field Skills Tools     Data Analysis R, Python, Statistics SAS, Jupyter, R Studio, MATLAB, Excel, RapidMiner   Data Warehousing ETL, SQL, Hadoop, Apache Spark Informatica/ Talend, AWS Redshift   Data Visualization R, Python libraries Jupyter, Tableau, Cognos, RAW   Machine Learning Python, Algebra, Machine learning algorithms, Statistics Spark MLib, Mahout, Azure ML studio    \rRange of Technologies Brands in Data Science\r\rData Science Lifecycle \rData Science Lifecycle\r\rData science projects are conducted through several processes, so it is important to have a general structure to follow. There are no rules or stricts procedures to follow in a data science project. However, the following lifecycle outlines the major stages that projects typically execute, often iteratively:\n Business Understanding : This is the first step of all data science projects. It includes two main tasks :   Define objectives: Work with your customer and other stakeholders to understand and identify the business problems. Formulate questions that define the business goals that the data science techniques can target. Identify data sources: Find the relevant data that helps you answer the questions that define the objectives of the project.   Data Collection : It is not an easy process. It involves so many tasks such as identifying your data requirements, deciding on a method of data collection, and finally organizing a data collection plan that synthesizes the most important aspects of your program.\n  Data Preparation : This step is also known as Data Cleaning or Data Wrangling. It includes steps like selecting the relevant data, integrating the data by merging the data sets, cleaning it, handling the missing values by either removing them or imputing them with relevant data, treating erroneous data by removing them, also check for outliers and handle them. Constructing new data, derive new features from existing ones by using the feature engineering. Format the data into the desired structure, remove unwanted columns and features. Data preparation is the most time consuming as it takes up to 80% of the overall project time, yet it‚Äôs the most important step in the entire life cycle.\n  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) : This is not a formal process with a strict set of rules. It is rather a mindset that incites you to analyze and investigate your data sets and summarize their main characteristics, often employing data visualization methods. It helps you to figure out the best way to manipulate your data. In this stage, you may want to do the following tasks :\n   Generate questions about your data Search for answers by visualising, transforming, and modelling your data Use what you learn to refine your questions and/or generate new questions   Modeling : Data modeling is the process of creating a visual representation of either a whole information system or parts of it to communicate connections between data points and structures. The goal is to illustrate the types of data used and stored within the system, the relationships among these data types, the ways the data can be grouped and organized and its formats and attributes.Data modeling employs standardized schemas and formal techniques. This provides a common, consistent, and predictable way of defining and managing data resources across an organization, or even beyond.\n  Model Evaluation : In the end we need to evaluate the model by measuring the accuracy (How well the model performs i.e. does it describe the data accurately) and relevance (Does it answer the original question that is set out to answer). We also need to make sure there is a correct balance between performance and generalizability, which means the model created should not be biased and should be a generalized model.\n  Model Deployment : In order to start using a model for practical decision-making, it needs to be effectively deployed into production. Depending on the requirements, the deployment phase can be as simple as generating a report or as complex as implementing a repeatable data science process. In many cases, it will be the customer, not the data analyst, who will carry out the deployment steps. For example, a credit card company may want to deploy a trained model or set of models (e.g., neural networks, meta-learner) to quickly identify transactions, which have a high probability of being fraudulent. However, even if the analyst will not carry out the deployment effort it is important for the customer to understand up front what actions will need to be carried out in order to actually make use of the created models.\n  Conclusion In the end, we won\u0026rsquo;t be wrong to say that Data Science is driving the future of almost all industries as it is the fastest growing discipline in computer science and IT with all its active community and the new tools being developped continuously.\n",
