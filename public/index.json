    "body": " \u0026ldquo;What we want is a machine that can learn from experience\u0026rdquo;\nAlan Turing, 1947\n What is machine learning ? ¬†Machine learning is a form of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows a system to learn from data without explicitly programming the instructions to be executed. However, machine learning is not a simple process. As the algorithms ingest the training data, it becomes possible to create more accurate models based on that data. A machine learning model is the output generated when you train your machine learning algorithm with data. After training, when you provide input data to a model, you receive an output result. For example, a predictive algorithm creates a predictive model. Then, when you provide data to the predictive model, you receive a forecast that is determined by the data that was used to train the model.\nIterative learning from data ¬†Machine learning allows models to train on datasets before being deployed. Some machine learning models are online and operate continuously. This iterative process of inline models improves the types of associations established between data elements. Due to their complexity and size, these trends and associations may not be detected by a human observer. Once a model has been trained, it can be used in real time to learn from the data. Improvements in accuracy result from the training and automation process that is part of machine learning.\nMachine learning approaches ¬†Machine learning techniques are needed to improve the accuracy of predictive models. Depending on the nature of the business problem being addressed, there are different approaches that vary depending on the type and volume of data. In this section, we discuss the categories of machine learning.\nSupervised learning Supervised learning usually begins with a well-defined data set and some understanding of how that data is classified. The goal of supervised learning is to uncover patterns in data and apply them to an analytical process. These data include characteristics associated with labels that define their meaning. You can, for example, create a machine learning application that can distinguish between millions of animals, based on pictures and written descriptions.\nUnsupervised learning Unsupervised learning is used when the problem requires a massive amount of unlabeled data. For example, social media apps like Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat all mine very large amounts of untagged data. To understand the meaning of this data, it is necessary to use algorithms that classify the data according to the trends or clusters they detect. Unsupervised learning leads an iterative process, analyzing data without human intervention. It is used with spam detection technology sent by e-mail. Normal emails and spam have too many variables for an analyst to tag spam emails sent in bulk. In contrast, machine learning discriminants, based on clustering and association, are applied to identify unwanted emails.\nReinforcement learning Reinforcement learning is a model of behavioral learning. The algorithm receives feedback from the data analysis and guides the user to the best result. Reinforcement learning differs from other types of supervised learning in that the system is not trained with a sample data set. Instead, the system learns instead through a trial and error method. Therefore, a sequence of successful decisions results in the strengthening of the process, because it is the process that most effectively solves the problem at hand.\nNeural networks and deep learning  \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Deep learning is a specific method of machine learning that integrates neural networks in successive layers in order to learn data iteratively. Deep learning is especially useful when trying to spot trends from unstructured data. Complex deep learning neural networks are designed to emulate how the human brain works, so computers can be trained to deal with ill-defined abstractions and problems. Most five-year-olds easily distinguish the face of their teacher from that of the officer responsible for taking them across the crosswalk. On the other hand, the computer must do a considerable amount of work to identify each face. Neural networks and deep learning are often used in image recognition, oral communication and digital vision applications.",

    "body": "‚Üí[CV] ‚Üê This website will give you an overview of my academic and professional career, as well as some of my interests. And you will also find some articles about different topics.\nI am a Data Engineering student in my 2nd year at the National Institute of Posts and Telecommunications, Rabat, Morocco.\nMy educational career was marked by a lot of moving between cities and compuses (Akka, Tata, Taroudant, Agadir, Rabat\u0026hellip;). And this made a significant contribution in the process of developping my personality, building my network, and acquiring a variety of skills.\nI had my baccalaureate in Mathematical Sciences in 2017 with an Honours degree at the Technical Highschool, Taroudant, Morocco. I then went to Mohammed Reda Slaoui Preparatory Classes in Agadir the same year and studied Maths And Physics for two years. In 2019, I went to the National Institute of Posts and Telecommunications in Rabat where I\u0026rsquo;m still studying Data Engineering in my 2nd year now.\nMain interests and projects My main interests are Data Science, Machine Learning, and Marketing Analysis. The first time I worked on a machine learning project was in my final year at the Preparatory Classes as part of the TIPE (Traveaux d\u0026rsquo;Initiative Personnelle Encadr√©s), in which I trained a convolutional neural network to guide a vehicle through an empty track. I used Udacity\u0026rsquo;s Self-Driving Car Simulator for generating the training and the testing data (TRAINING MODE), as well as for testing the performance of the car after I paired it with the trained model (AUTONOMOUS MODE).\nI had so much fun working on this project. I especially enjoyed the process of collecting data and testing the car on the simulator.\nI also carried out a web scrapping project in which I extracted around 13 000 items on the famous advertisements website Avito.ma using requests and BeautifulSoup and performed statistical studies on them.\nI love NLP (Natural Language Processing), and my latest mini-project was about determining, among a set of tweets, which relate to a disaster and which don\u0026rsquo;t, using NLP along with different machine learning algorithms, and then I compared the efficiency of each one of these algorithms.\nBadges and certificates I am glad that I had the chance to take many online courses in different domains especially those related to my area of expertise and earn a certificate for each one of them :\n   Badge/Certificate Date Issued by     Using Databases With Python November 2020 Coursera   R 101 November 2020 IBM   HCIA Big Data August 2020 Huawei   Natural Language Processing July 2020 Coursera (With Honors)   Scrum Foundation Professional Certificate (SFPC) August 2020 CertiProf   Lifelong Learning August 2020 CertiProf   HCIA Artificial Intelligence July 2020 Huawei   Data Science for Business - Level 1 May 2020 IBM   Data Science Orientation April 2020 IBM   Python For Data Science April 2020 IBM   Data Science Hands-On With Open Source Tools April 2020 IBM   Advanced Google Analytics April 2020 Google   Google Analytics For Beginners Mars 2020 Google    Extracurricular \u0026amp; Volunteering Experiences As an active member of CIT Club, I\u0026rsquo;ve proudly been part of the organization staff of its two main events (JNJD and IDEH) last year. And this year, I have been elected Treasurer of the club.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve also volunteered as an organizer of the 1st edition of the Digital Job Fair.\nHobbies and pastime activities I\u0026rsquo;m so passionate about photography üì∏ , music üé∂, and reading üìö\nThanks for passing by! üòÑ\nPlease feel free to contact me.\n",
