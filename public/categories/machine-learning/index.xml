      <description>&amp;ldquo;What we want is a machine that can learn from experience&amp;rdquo;
Alan Turing, 1947
 What is machine learning ? Â Machine learning is a form of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows a system to learn from data without explicitly programming the instructions to be executed. However, machine learning is not a simple process. As the algorithms ingest the training data, it becomes possible to create more accurate models based on that data.</description>
